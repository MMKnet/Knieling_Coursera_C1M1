# -- Repo Details --
# This repository was created for the Coursera course "Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments" 
# and serves as a version controlled storage for the first week assignment. The repository just contains three files:
# 1) README.md --> Author, Repo and Project Details (this file), 2) stats.h --> declaration and documentation of the used functions
# and 3) stats.c --> implementaton of the functions

# -- Project Details --
# Within the first week assignment of the Coursera course "Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments" 
# a simple application is created that performs statistical analytics on a given dataset. Basically the main reason for this
# application is to bring all participants on the same page ragarding basic c-programing skills. In total eight functions are declared
# (in stats.h), described/documented (in stats.h) and implemented (in stats.c). For more details about the functions have a look into # the stats.h and stats.c files.
